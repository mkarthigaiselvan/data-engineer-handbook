# Spotify - User Journey

## Introduction
Spotify has been my go-to music streaming app for years. From discovery to personalization, it continuously impresses with how well it understands my taste.

## Initial Experience
- Signed up with Google and got instant access to a free tier.
- First impression: intuitive UI, easy search, and attractive design.
- Created my first playlist within minutes. Liked how the app suggested similar tracks as I added songs.

## Discovery Phase
- Started following artists and exploring curated playlists.
- Weekly Discover playlist became my favorite way to find new music.
- Shared playlists with friends and received some in return — made Spotify a social experience.

## Premium Upgrade
- Ads and shuffle limits got annoying, so I moved to Premium.
- Offline downloads and ad-free listening were huge value additions.
- Used the student discount initially, later transitioned to the family plan.

## Current Usage
- Daily usage includes:
  - Discover Weekly
  - Personalized Daily Mixes
  - Podcasts during commutes
- Spotify Wrapped is a highlight of every year — feels personal and fun.

## Why I Love It
- Personalized recommendations are incredibly accurate.
- Seamless cross-device experience (phone → desktop → smart speaker).
- Always discovering something new without trying too hard.
